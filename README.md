# Scala.js GCP Cloud Functions starter template

This [Giter8][g8] template is for getting up and running with Google Cloud Functions (GCP Cloud Functions)
using a minimal setup with scalaJS.

Open a console and run the following command to apply this template:

```sbt
sbt new TobiasRoland/scalajs-gcp-cloud-functions.g8
```

This template will prompt for the **name** of the project, **package** and **cloudFunctionName**. If you are happy with the defaults or unsure what to do - press `ENTER` to confirm default options.

Once inside the newly created project folder, compile the function to javascript and deploy the resulting code to Google Cloud Functions.

```sbt
sbt fullOptJS
```

See README.md of the newly created project for detailed steps.
